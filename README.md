# Little Lemon Booking Website

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **Little Lemon Booking Website**! ðŸŽ‰ This project was developed as part of **Meta's Coursera Front-End Development course**, specifically as the capstone project for the **Front-End Development Track**. It serves as the culmination of learning how to build dynamic and responsive websites using modern web development tools.

The website is designed to be a **booking application** for the fictional **Little Lemon** restaurant. It showcases how React can be utilized to create a modern, interactive web application. The project highlights the use of **React Components**, **React Router**, and **API calls** to build a seamless user experience.
